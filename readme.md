# dgmisc

Daniel and Gretchen's miscellaneous R functions for research.  Primarily used as vehicle for documenting, distributing and maintaining otherwise disjointed bits of code.

## Installation
This package is not now, nor will it ever likely be, on CRAN but you can install it from here on GitHub using Hadley Wickham's `devtools` package.  Users on Windows will also need the [R Build Tools][rtools] corresponding to their version of R.

```
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('dpritchard/dgmisc')
library(dgmisc)
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributors of all skill levels!  If you would like to contribute to this project please [contact Daniel][dpcontact].  

If you'd like to contribute, please read the devtools [style guide][hwsg] before spending too much time coding out a complex function for inclusion here.
